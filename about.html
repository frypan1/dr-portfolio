        <h2 class="section-heading">Detailed Scope</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since February 1987 I was working in the ENT Department of
          the King Fahd Specialist Hospital. King Fahd Specialist Hospital
          as a tertiary care Hospital and the premiere institute in the Gassim
          region of Saudi Arabia. It is 574 bed referral hospitall for 25
          hospitals in the region, The hospital is well equiped with the latest
          technology including CT Scan, MRI scan, ultrasonographs, color
          Doppler scanners, radioisotope scanners etc. All the medical and
          surgical specialities are represented. The hospital is recognised
          teaching hospital for post-graduate studies by the Arab Board of
          Medical studies and the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of United
          Kingdom and Ireland.</p><br>
         <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          The ENT Department has 36 beds, holding 4-5 clinic sessions per
          week and a daily operation schedule. The department is
          responsible for 500,000 people of the region. The department has
          2 units of Audiology and Phoniatry, both equipped with highly
          sophisticated instruments. An average of 30 patients are seen in
          the clinics each day and about 25 operations are performed each
          week.</p><br>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          The bulk of the operative work consists of
          adenotondillectomies, endoscopies, tympanoplasties and
          septoplasties. Since the beginning I am working in clinics, wards
          and operation theaters, first under the supervision of my senior
          consultant, and later independently, in investigating and
          treating patients with minor and major disabilities in ENT.
          </p><br>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          In OR, I performed all kinds of macro and micro surgical
          operations and a good number of tympanoplasties with
          mastoidectomies. I am conversant in endoscopic procedures
          e.g laryngotracheobronchoscopies, and microendoscopic laryngeal
          surgeries. King Fahd Specialist Hospital being a tertiary centre
          gets a large number of referral with foreign bodies in the above
          organs.</p><br>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          During this period I have worked as Locum specialist in ENT
          surgery for 45 days in the AlMidnab general Hospital, In Algassim
          region.</p><br>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          My special interests are in the field of micro ear surgery and
          endoscopic surgery.</p><br>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          Since March 98, I am working as an ENT consultant and head of
         the Department of ENT in Buraidah Central Hospital. BCH is
          A secondary care hospital, and is the oldest general hospital
          in Gassim region. It has capacity of 400 bed in which all
          surgical and medical specialities are represented.</p><br>
          <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          The ENT department has three ENT consultants and 5 specialist
         and holds daily clinic session for two times. Average 30-35 patients
          are seen in the clinic everyday. Three separate operation days
          with an average of 15-20 cases per week is done excluding the
          emergencies. The bulk of operative work consists of adeno-
          tonsillectomies, nasal polypectomies,septoplasties, myringo-
          -tomies, tympanoplasties, tracheostomies and endoscopy
          proceedures, done by each doctor individually on his
          days. In hospital referrals from attached hospitals like Maternity
         and Child Hoapital, Chest Hospital and Psychiatry Hospital are
         also seen by us.</p><br>
         <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          I also did Locum Assistant Consultant job in King Fahad Specialist
          Hospital during my vacation period in the 2004.
          During my this tenure many conferences were attended as speaker
          and most of them were CME approved.</p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Thesis Work</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During my post-graduation I submitted a thesis on “Assessment
          of Vertigo and its management”. My University accepted the
          thesis as postgraduate dissertation. In the thesis 70 cases suffering
          from vertigo were studied by concentional methods, and an
          analysis was made with the new method of portable
          craniocarpography. With these methods, cases were managed in
          association with Dr.S.S.Bhutada, Honarary Professor in Sassoon
          General Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra.
